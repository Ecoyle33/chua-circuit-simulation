# chua-circuit-simulation
Using the SciPy, Pandas and Numpy libraries, I and my lab partner Hector Solway created simulations modelling the behaviour of a Chua Circuit made by ourselves. The work that went into both these projects was managed equally by the both of us

# Modeling Chua's circuit

### Todo:
1. Build and model minimal chua circuit
2. Use model to investigate multi-scroll producing circuits
3. Build multi-scroll circuit
4. Test circuit encryption capabilities of new circuit in comparison to minimal one
